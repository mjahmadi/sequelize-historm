## Introduction
The Sequelize Historm plugin is a powerful tool that allows you to track and manage changes to your Sequelize models. With this plugin, you can easily keep a record of all modifications made to your database, enabling you to track historical data and analyze changes over time.

## Features
Change Tracking: The plugin automatically tracks changes made to your Sequelize models, including inserts, updates, and deletions.
Historical Data: You can access the historical data for any model and retrieve previous versions of records.
Timestamps: The plugin automatically adds timestamps to each historical record, allowing you to see when a change occurred.
User Tracking: You can associate each change with a user, providing accountability and traceability.
Efficient Storage: The plugin uses a compact storage format to minimize the impact on your database size.
Easy Integration: The plugin seamlessly integrates with your existing Sequelize setup, requiring minimal configuration.

## Installation
To install the Sequelize History plugin, simply run the following command:
```bash
npm install sequelize-history
```

## Usage
To enable history tracking for a Sequelize model, follow these steps:

Import the sequelize-history module:

```js
const sequelizeHistory = require('sequelize-history');
```

Add the sequelizeHistory plugin to your Sequelize model:
```js
const MyModel = sequelize.define('MyModel', {
  // Define your model attributes
});

MyModel.plugin(sequelizeHistory);
```

That's it! Your model is now being tracked by the Sequelize History plugin. You can access the historical data using the getHistory method:
```js
const history = await MyModel.getHistory();
console.log(history);
```
